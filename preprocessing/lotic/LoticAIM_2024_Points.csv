FROM SILVER CLIFF, HEAD NORTH ON 255 FOR 15 MILES, TAKE A LEFT ON ACCESS RD. 6227 AND FOLLOW ALL THE WAY DOWN TO GRAPE CREEK. SITE IS ROUGHLY 1.5 MILES DOWNSTREAM
Simple hike down BLM Trail 6227 to the point from an access road and parking area.
•	Grape Creek – Best access to this point is from the Bear Gulch parking lot (105.346610 W , 38.321134 N). Take the Oak Creek Grade (CR 143) to BLM Access Rd 6227. This is a popular fishing spot, so there is plenty of information online. From the parking lot, hike down to the creek and cross. The target is 1.7 miles upstream. The hike is flat and often follows a cattle trail along the creek side. Crossings are easy, especially with waders. The heat and sun will be the greatest hazard down there in the canyon.
